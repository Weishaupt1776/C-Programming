Hey there,

You have found the small hope of my existence. And I hope that I can animate this lively, joyous part of myself for you.
Within me, I have the hopefulness and idealism to carry out this Great Work.
I hope that whomever is reading, however distant, will find some light out of this sacrifice.

No matter the hopelessness
No matter the fog
Perdurabo, unto the end

Thank you,
David
